Pomodoro style timer that allows you to set 2 times, and the clock will alternate between them. The clock is used as a “GTD” method. (Getting
Things Done). The idea is to create a “work time” with a longer length of 25 minutes or more, and a shorter “break time”. You then set the timer 
and work without distraction for the duration of the work time until the timer goes off, and then you take a short break for the duration of the
break timer, and then it’s back to work! Repeat until your task is complete. 

The development of this method is attributed to Francesco Cirillo who used it as a university student. “Pomodoro” is the Japanese word for tomato,
and is named due to the tomato design of the kitchen timer Cirillo originally used. 

Future plans: None. I can’t think of any additional functionality to add to this app. Any ideas are appreciated!
